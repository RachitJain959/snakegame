# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This classic game brings back the nostalgia of guiding a snake to eat food and grow while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. Control the snake's movements using your keyboard's arrow keys and aim to achieve the highest score possible.

## Gameplay

In the Snake Game, you'll find the following features:

- A moving snake that you control using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
- The snake grows in length as it consumes food items.
- Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body to stay alive.
- The game ends when the snake hits a wall or collides with its own body.
- Your objective is to eat as much food as possible while keeping the snake alive and avoiding obstacles.

## Parts of the Project

The Snake Game project was developed in several stages:

1. Creating Snake Body: The snake's body is composed of three squares initially lined up next to each other.

2. Moving the Snake: All three squares of the snake move simultaneously, creating the illusion of a continuous motion.

3. Controlling the Snake: Players can use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) to control the snake's direction.

4. Detecting Collision with Food: When the snake consumes food, a new piece of food is randomly generated on the screen.

5. Creating Scoreboard: The score updates automatically when the snake eats food.

6. Detecting Wall Collision: The game ends and displays "Game Over" when the snake collides with a wall.

7. Detecting Collision with Snake Tail: The game also ends when the snake collides with its own body.
